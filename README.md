# Propactive Demo (Spring Boot) 

## Overview

This project was initially part of a research assessment for JetBrains. It has been repurposed as a sample project demonstrating the use of the [Propactive](https://github.com/propactive/propactive?tab=readme-ov-file#propactive) framework in a simple Spring Boot application.

- You can observe the project state before and after the Propactive framework was [onboarded in this commit](https://github.com/propactive/propactive-demo-spring-boot/commit/54883d3e4831ecf8a7f2f291d82db133b32f680b).
- The properties implementation class can be [found here](https://github.com/propactive/propactive-demo-spring-boot/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/org/example/assignment/config/Properties.kt).

Given that Propactive automatically generates the application properties by default, no further changes were required to maintain the same application flow for this Spring Boot app. The addition simply provided 10 unit tests out-of-the-box for free. ðŸ™‚


## Original Instructions

### Operating a robot

We are operating a robot. The robot can move in four directions only: North, East, West, and South. Each move is specified as a direction and a number of steps.

### The task

Using Spring Boot (or any other web framework you choose), implement a simple web service in Java with two endpoints. The application should store the input data and the corresponding result for each request in a database. You can use any data access library/framework and database to implement the service.

Donâ€™t forget to commit your changes as you usually do when implementing such a project. Feel free to use any IDE features and follow any standard development practices.

*Optional*: Add 1-2 unit tests to cover simple cases. 


The web service endpoints should implement the following functionality:

1. Receives a list of movement operations in JSON format as an input and outputs the coordinates recorded after each move as a JSON document. Assume that the initial location for the robot is always at (0, 0).

   Example of a curl command to test your implementation:
   
   ```bash
   curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --request POST \
   --data '[{"direction":"EAST","steps":1},{"direction":"NORTH","steps":3},{"direction":"EAST","steps":3},
            {"direction":"SOUTH","steps":5},{"direction":"WEST","steps":2}]' \
   http://localhost:8080/locations
   ```
   
   Result:
   ```json
   [{"x":0,"y":0},{"x":1,"y":0},{"x":1,"y":3},{"x":4,"y":3},{"x":4,"y":-2},{"x":2,"y":-2}]
   ```

2. Receives a list of locations and outputs a list of robot moves to visit all locations. Assume that the starting location of the robot is the first in the input list.

   Example of a curl command to test your implementation:
   
   ```bash
   curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --request POST \
     --data '[{"x": 0, "y": 0}, {"x": 1, "y": 0}, {"x": 1, "y": 3}, {"x": 0, "y": 3}, {"x": 0, "y": 0}]' \
     http://localhost:8080/moves
   ```
   
   Result:
   ```json
   [{"direction":"EAST","steps":1},{"direction":"NORTH","steps":3},{"direction":"WEST","steps":1},{"direction":"SOUTH","steps":3}]
   ```

* *Optional*: Find the shortest path through all of the locations provided as an input.
* *Note*: For testing you could also use commands from [requests.http](requests.http)
